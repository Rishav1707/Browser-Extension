# Browser-Extension

### I've finished building an OpenSauced browser extension that connects to the OpenSauced API and performs the following tasks:-
- It fetches the `username` from the GitHub profile and checks whether the user has an `account` on the OpenSauced website or not.
- If the user is validated then it renders the button on the profile named `View on OpenSauced` which has the click functionalities that take you to the `OpenSauced profile` page.
- If the user is not validated then it renders the button on the profile named `Join OpenSauced` which has also the click functionalities that take you to the `OpenSauced authentication` page.
- It also authenticates the user using an `auth token` and displays a text as `You are an authorized user of OpenSauced. Logged in as {username}` after verifying the user.
